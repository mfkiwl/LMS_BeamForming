# LMS_BeamForming
Beamforming aim is to be able to to steer the main lobe in a given direction and/or reject the interfering signals coming from specific direction. our channel is Quadriga, the signals are OFDM signals.

The geometry is 3D. The position of transmitters and base station are as follows: base station (3D coordinates) [0; 0; 25], start position for vehicle 1 [70; −100; 1:5] ,end position for vehicle 1 (movement in y) [70; 100; 1:5] and for second vehicle start position is = [200; −50; 1:5] , end position is(movement in x) [10; −50; 1:5] and position of first interferer [10; −210; 1:5] and position of second interferer [−150; 100; 1:5] . There are two interferers as well and they are fixed and they don’t move. The antenna is a 4 × 4 antenna array and the antenna spacing is λ2 . As it was discussed the channel model is Quadriga. As it is shown in figure 1 the number of the coefficient is 34, the first coefficient is LOS(Line Of Sight) path and the others are for NLOS(Non-Line Of Sight) paths. Channel is consists of four subchannels and each one has its coefficients and delays.
